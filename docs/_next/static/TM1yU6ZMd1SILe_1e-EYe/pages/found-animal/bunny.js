Natural behavior for wild rabbits is for the mom to bed her babies down in a nest, but not stay with them. The babies do not have any scent, and mom stays away in order to keep predators from finding the nest. She returns twice a day (usually early morning and evening) to quickly check on her babies and nurse them, and may spend as little as ten minutes a day tending to her young."],"image":[]},{"title":"How to help","text":["1. If the baby rabbits seem warm and have full tummies, they are most likely being fed by mom.","To check for mom\u2019s return, you can either cross some sticks over the babies or place flour around the nest. Check back later to see if the sticks have moved or if there are footprints in the flour from mom.","2. If after 12 hours there is still no sign of mom, please call a rehabilitator for help.","3. If you have determined that the babies are truly abandoned, or if they have been cat-caught, keep the babies WARM (not too hot) and rehydrate with warm Pedialyte or Gatorade (no milk or formula) and contact a wildlife rehabilitator for assistance."],"image":["../static/bunny1.png","../static/bunny2.png"]},{"title":"Don\u2019t pet, feed, talk to or hold the rabbit.","text":["This is a wild animal.
