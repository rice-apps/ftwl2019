            "text": "1. If a fawn is obviously ill, lying on its side, kicking, crying or is covered with
            fire ants, pick it up and place it in a box or animal carrier.
            A light cloth placed over the animal's head will sometimes calm it. Keep it
            away from pets and all human activity. Call Friends of Texas Wildlife at once for
            help. 
            2. If an uninjured fawn is seen, leave it alone and leave the area.
            The fawn would not be there if the doe were not nearby. You will not see her.
            She will return for the fawn only when there are no humans nearby. If you have removed
            the fawn from its resting spot, TAKE IT BACK AT ONCE and walk away. The doe will be
            searching for her fawn and will accept it even with a human scent on it.",

            "text": "This is a wild animal. Human voices, odor and touch only add to the stress and will cause additional harm. 

            Do not try to make a wild animal your pet. Not only is it not fair to the animal, it is against the law. 
            According to Chapter 63, Section 63.002 of the Parks and Wildlife Code no person can possess a live game 
            animal for any purpose not authorized by their code. The first offense for illegal possession of a live deer 
            is a Class C misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $500 plus court costs. There are similar laws for 
            possession of other animals such as raccoons.",
