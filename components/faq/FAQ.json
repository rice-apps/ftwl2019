                "Periodically, over a 3 day period, go into the attic and make a lot of noise. Blow whistles, honk air horns, and clang pots and pans. You can also attach a box or cans to a cord, toss it into the attic, and drag it across the rafters. Make the noise during the sleep period of the animal (raccoons sleep during the day; squirrels at night).",

                "You must now repair the animalâ€™s access to the attic. Block entryways with thick boards or wire and trim back tree branches. Other squirrels and raccoons are waiting to take up residence in your attic, so act quickly.",
